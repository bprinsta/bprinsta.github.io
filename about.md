Hi, my name's Ben! I'm a student at Princeton University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I'm particularly concerned with how technology, innovation, and design can be used to make the world a better place. 

In my spare time I enjoy writing stories, creating playlists, playing sports, and reading upon various subjects.
